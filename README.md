This project contains a list of Jupyter Notebooks where I try to implement several common Neural Network using only numpy

I demonstrate the process of building and training neural networks from scratch for various tasks. First, I create a Deep Neural Network (DNN) using NumPy to classify labels in a 2D spiral dataset. Then, I implement a basic Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for sentiment analysis, followed by using a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) model to tackle the same task. Lastly, I explore the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture for sentiment analysis, although some errors remain to be fixed.
